        <h2>Which games to play</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraf">
        <p>The first thing you want to know if want to play videogames is which game do you want to play, there are many different types of video games out there but there is a general consensus that videogames can be divided in different categories for example if you like Mario Bros those games are generally consider a platform games and you can look for more similar games and you can find games like Sonny or try new and interesting ideas in the same platform games genre like Celeste.So if you are not sure try to think about a game you used you play to went you were younger or try to see if you a game on your phone that you like and you would probably find more games that you like many for the way play them or for their story.</p>

    <div class="paragraf">
        <P>There are 5 main types of ways to play videogames today there is your phone thats is probably the cheapest and most convenient with hundreds of games releasing every day but sadly many games are of a really bad quality and other just seen to want to take as much money as they can from you so many people end expending more on mobile games than others that have consoles or PCs to play,If you like the Mario games it may be a good idea to start with a Nintendo switch, but if you prefer a different style of games one that has usually more mature stories or like playing sports games like FIFA or NBA2K a playstation or an Xbox may be better for you and if you want to experience those games with better graphics and more options a Pc may be best for you it all depends on how much money you have want to expand and what games you want to play.</P>
